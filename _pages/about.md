I am an undergraduate student at the University of Costa Rica (UCR) pursuing concurrent B.A. degrees in Economics and Mathematics. My primary research interests include Monetary Economics, Applied Macroeconomics, and International Economics. I am currently working as a research assistant, mentored by Dr. Jose P. Vasquez and Dr. Isabela Manelici of the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE). 

In line with my current research interests, I am particularly engaged in a project analyzing "Inflationary Convergence in Costa Rica" alongside Alberth Vargas Miranda (UCR). In this work, we are implementing a state-of-the-art state-space model that integrates both realized inflation data and long-run inflation expectations. The goal is to recover the underlying inflationary trend within Costa Rica to empirically assess the Central Bank's compliance with its 3% inflation target. Our preliminary estimates are significant, revealing a persistent inflationary trend that has remained consistently below the target. This finding suggests the potential presence of an excessively contractionary monetary stance. 

I was awarded first-place winner of the 2024 Latin American Reserve Fund (FLAR) Research Contest. My winning paper, "Supply Shocks, Monetary Policy and Foreign Investment: The Costa Rican Case", investigates the country's atypical display of accelerated growth and deflation following global supply shocks. I used a New Keynesian Growth Model to argue that the interplay between foreign investment attraction and nearshoring was a key driver of this outcome. I have had the opportunity to present this research at the Central Bank of Costa Rica.

I am technically proficient in R, Stata, Python and LaTeX; and familiar with MATLAB, LaTeX, Git, and Dynare.
